## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)


### What I learned

The project could easily be done with HTML, CSS and JS but I decided to practice React with the project. I had a bit of trouble with using props due to my arrangement of components so I used localStorage instead and it worked perfectly. I also got to put into practice responsiveness with tailwindcss.


### Continued development

I will keep working on more projects with React and TailwindCSS to become more comfortable with the framework. I will also learn more about working with props.


### Useful resources

- [Tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/) - I used this documentation to check the names of classes I wasn't familiar with yet. I also learnt mobile responsiveness using tailwindcss.
- [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - This documentation helped with refreshing my memory. I could always fall back to confirm techniques being used.
